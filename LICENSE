Introduction
	Vocabulary
The “original authors” refers to the original creator of the project, which is also the copyright holder of the project. The original code/project/source refers to the original code or work and the fork refers to the derivative work or code. Each licensee is addressed as "you". The verb “redistribute” is used as a general verb for “copy” and “redistribute”.

	What this license applies to
This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the original project, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole regardless of who wrote it.

I) Making changes
	a) Permissions
You may redistribute the source by making noticeable changes, you are free to choose the type of changes you’ll make, but they must respect this license. Changes that will gain funds to the fork author(s) require permission from the original authors.

	b) Requirements
Significant changes to the code must be made inside your fork. These changes include style changes, features changes and branding changes. These changes must be visible to the user. If no significant changes are made, the original authors have the right to revoke your rights. 
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.


II) Licensing
	a) Attribution
You are allowed to redistribute, copy the original source, as long as you attribute proper credit to the original authors, crediting includes, mentioning the original author’s names, the original license, the original copyright notice, the original product name and a link to the original source. The attribution must be accessible to the average user in your application.

	b) Fork licensing
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the original source or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

You shall not modify any part of this license when redistributing the original source. 

	c) License and copyright notice
You may distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

	d) Sublicensing
You may not sublicense any part of the original source without the original authors permission. Sublicensing the original source without the original authors permission will result in sanctions as described in section 5 of this license.

III) Distributing
	a) Commercial use
Commercial use refers to any methods that gain funds to you, including advertising or selling. Any act of commercial use requires permission from the original authors.

	b) Branding
You shall not redistribute the original author’s work with the same trademark and branding. Your branding should also be significantly different from the original branding. Any user should be able to distinguish your application from the original application.

IV) Original authors rights and responsibility
	a) Responsibility
In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

	b) License sanctions
By modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. If you do not accept or respect this license, your rights will be terminated.

V) External sanctions
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not re-distribute the original source at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the original source by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
